# Welcome to Atelier Damillora

This is a documentation and showcase of the older computers I somehow managed to get.

The name "Atelier Damillora" came about because, while it is sort of a workshop for my explorations into older hardware, the main reason is that all of the computers in here I ended up naming after characters from the [Atelier video game series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_(video_game_series)). That was the other thing I was *really* interested in at the time I started getting interested in older computers! It is also a pretty old series, with the original Atelier Marie released in *1997*.
